These are the various projects that I have completed during my time working for the Trenton Thunder, as well as on my own. 
The Interactive Hitters Dashboard has a pdf corresponding with it, displaying each page of the app.
The Artcles Corresponding to My WRC+ and Slugging models can be found at https://80grade.wordpress.com/
