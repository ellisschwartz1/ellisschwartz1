### Ellis Schwartz Computer Programming Portfolio
These are the various projects that I have completed during my time working for the Trenton Thunder, as well as on my own. 
The Interactive Hitters Dashboard has a corresponding pdf displaying each page of the app.
The artcles associated with My WRC+ and Slugging models can be found at https://80grade.wordpress.com/
Additionally, I have included a sample deliverable that I created with data visualizations and analysis, titled Perpay_Deliverable.pdf
